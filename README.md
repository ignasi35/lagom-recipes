## Lagom Recipes

This repository contains code samples to help understand how to solve common problems. In general, code in each folder of this repository tries to answer a question of type "How do I xyz?".

* How do I enable CORS? (using Lagom's [javadsl](./cors/cors-java/README.md) or [scaladsl](./cors/cors-scala/README.md))
* How do I create a [Subscriber only service](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.3.x/java/KafkaClient.html#Subscriber-only-Services)? (also referred to as [consumer service](./consumer-service/consumer-service-java-sbt/README.md))
* How do I use RDBMS read-sides with Cassandra write-sides? (aka [mixed persistence](mixed-persistence/mixed-persistence-java-sbt/README.md))
